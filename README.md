ShellBox
=========

ShellBox helps you to organize your **shellscripts** by splitting them in **commands libraries**.

If you spend much time on unix consoles in your developer's life, you probably built a set of ninja's scripts you use everyday to work an efficient way. ShellBox's original purpose is to provide a frame to build *project development Command Line Interfaces* (= your set of ninja's scripts). So ShellBox is designed for you!
